INTRODUCTION
Every company follows a different coding standard based on their best practices.
Coding standard is required because there may be many developers working on different 
modules so if they will start inventing their own standards then source will become
very un-manageable and it will become difficult to maintain that source code in future.

Now that we know that, Lets Get started!
Indenting and Line Length
*Use an indent of 4 spaces and don't use any tab because different computers use different
 setting for tab. It is recommended to keep lines at approximately 75-85 characters long 
 for better code readability.
Control Structures

*These include if, for, while, switch, etc. Control statements should have one space between
 the control keyword and opening parenthesis, to distinguish them from function calls.
 You are strongly encouraged to always use curly braces even in situations where they are
 technically optional.

Function Calls

*Functions should be called with no spaces between the function name,
 the opening parenthesis, and the first parameter; spaces between commas and each parameter,
 and no space between the last parameter, the closing parenthesis, and the semicolon.

Function Definitions

*Function declarations follow the "BSD/Allman style" Comments − C style comments (/* */) and
 standard C++ comments (//) are both fine. Use of Perl/shell style comments (#) is discouraged.

PHP Code Tags 

*Always use <?php ?> to delimit PHP code, not the <? ?> shorthand.
 This is required for PHP compliance and is also the most portable way to include PHP code
 on differing operating systems and setups.

Variable Names −

    Use all lower case letters
    Use '_' as the word separator.
    Global variables should be prepended with a 'g'.
    Global constants should be all caps with '_' separators.
    Static variables may be prepended with 's'.

Make Functions Reentrant 
*Functions should not keep static variables that prevent a function from being reentrant.

Alignment of Declaration Blocks

*Block of declarations should be aligned.

One Statement Per Line
 
*There should be only one statement per line unless the statements are very closely related.

 Short Methods or Functions − Methods should limit themselves to a single page of code.
